# MasterPanel
MasterPanel is a powerful program designed to help users manage files remotely using SFTP and SSH protocols. With this program, users can securely connect to and manage files on remote computers from anywhere in the world. One of the key features of MasterPanel is its strong focus on security. The program uses state-of-the-art encryption technology to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.

Another notable feature of MasterPanel is its built-in IP scanner. This tool allows users to quickly scan their local network for connected computers, making it easy to identify and connect to remote computers without having to manually enter their IP addresses. Additionally, MasterPanel automatically remembers remote computer information, so users can quickly and easily reconnect to previously accessed machines with just a few clicks. This feature is particularly useful for users who frequently work with multiple remote computers or servers.
